# Dogs vs. Cats Classification Project

This repository contains experiments for distinguishing between dog and cat images using convolutional neural networks. The workflow focuses on the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset.

## Repository Contents
- `README.md`: Kaggle competition information and dataset details.
- `Untitled.ipynb`: Exploratory notebook experimenting with model architectures.
- `image resized/`: Preprocessed image samples used during model prototyping.
- `sampleSubmission.csv`: Template for submitting predictions to Kaggle.

## Getting Started
1. Download the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset and extract the images.
2. Place the training and test image folders alongside the notebooks or adjust paths inside the notebooks accordingly.
3. Use Jupyter Notebook to open `Untitled.ipynb` and execute the cells to train and evaluate models.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the notebook version)
- Standard scientific Python stack: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with improvements to preprocessing, model architecture, or evaluation strategies.
